We propose a news summarizer which takes news from several credible sources and turns it into a concise and precise read for the user using Machine Learning. This project to search and extract the required news for effective use and for the purpose of summarization. Many times the news are long and hefty and the user does not go beyond the headline due to the immense consumption of time. Thus our task is to provide as crisp as news can be covering all the important details. It is very important to make sure that the news is credible enough and should not be repetitive in nature. Hence we have to work on several important platforms and take several criteria into consideration. News summarizer holds an important role as to provide credible news which is to provide credible news which is to the point, in turn highly efficient in today's fast paced world.
